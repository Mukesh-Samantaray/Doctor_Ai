Yes, based on the image, the bumps and redness on your forehead are very consistent with what is commonly known as **acne vulgaris**.

I can see:
*   **Red bumps (papules):** Small, inflamed red bumps.
*   **White-headed bumps (pustules):** Bumps with a white or yellowish center, indicating pus.
*   **Inflammation:** The overall redness suggests significant inflammation.

**However, it's important to note:**

*   **I am an AI and cannot provide a medical diagnosis.**
*   While it strongly resembles typical acne, similar-looking conditions like **fungal acne (Malassezia folliculitis)** can also present this way, especially on the forehead. Fungal acne often consists of small, uniform bumps that can be itchy, and it requires different treatment than bacterial acne.

**Therefore, the most important step is to see a dermatologist or a healthcare professional.** They can properly diagnose the condition and recommend the most effective treatment plan for you.

In the meantime, you can try some general gentle skincare practices:
*   **Cleanse gently:** Wash your face twice daily with a mild, non-comedogenic cleanser.
*   **Avoid picking or squeezing:** This can worsen inflammation and lead to scarring.
*   **Use non-comedogenic products:** Choose moisturizers, sunscreens, and makeup that are labeled "non-comedogenic" or "non-acnegenic" to avoid clogging pores.
*   **Be patient:** Skin conditions take time to improve with treatment.
